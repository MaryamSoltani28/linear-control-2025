# 🔬 Researches - Advanced Topics in Control Engineering  

## 📌 Overview  
This folder contains **research materials, articles, and notes** related to **fundamental and advanced topics in control engineering**. Each research document explores critical aspects of **control theory**, providing both theoretical background and practical insights.  

## 📜 **Topics Covered**  
This research collection includes studies on the following key topics:  

### 📊 **1. Time Domain vs. Frequency Domain Analysis**  
- Understanding the fundamental differences between analyzing a system in the **time domain** vs. the **frequency domain**.  
- How **Laplace Transform** and **Fourier Transform** help in converting system responses between these two domains.  
- Practical applications of **time-domain** (step response, impulse response) vs. **frequency-domain** (Bode plot, Nyquist plot) analysis.  

### ⏳ **2. Delay, Root Locus, and System Stability**  
- The impact of **time delay** in control systems and how it affects stability.  
- Using **Root Locus** to analyze how **pole locations** change with controller gain.  
- Techniques to compensate for delay and stabilize the system.  

### 📏 **3. Routh-Hurwitz Stability Criterion**  
- Analyzing system stability without explicitly solving for poles.  
- Step-by-step application of the **Routh-Hurwitz Criterion** to determine stability.  
- Practical limitations and how to handle special cases (e.g., entire row of zeros).
